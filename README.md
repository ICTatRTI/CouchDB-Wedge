## Example of subscribing to a changes feed and changing every foo property that is false to true
The subscribe command can help with schema transformations and progressive data updates. When running, the subscribe command listens for new changes, and when new changes are detected, processes them in batches. With each change, you can have a custom action performed. If the processing is interrupted at any point, the command stores a state file on disk to track where it last left in the changes feed.

If the following example, any doc that has a property of `foo` with a value of `false` will be set to `true`. 

Place the following in an `action.js` file in the directory you run the command:
```
module.exports = async function (change, db) {
  console.log(change)
  const doc = await db.get(change.id)
  // Warning: If you don't check that something is done, it will be an infinite loop.
  if (doc.foo === false) {
    doc.foo = true
    db.put(doc)
  }
}
```

```
wedge subscribe --url http://admin:some-password@lexample.com:5984/some-database
```

## Example of a pull replication of all databases except for _replicator and resources
```
wedge replicate-all-dbs --worker https://username:password@serverb.cloudant.com --target https://username:password@serverb.example.com --source https://username:password@servera.example.com --exclude _replicator,resources
```


## Example of deleting all databases on a server except for _replicator and _users
```
wedge delete-all-dbs --target http://username:password@server.example.com --exclude _replicator,_users
```

This command has a prompt asking the user to confirm the action.

## Example of pre-warming CouchDB view cache, which forces generation of index for all databases on the couch server.

````
wedge pre-warm-views --target http://username:password@target-server.org
````

This command has a prompt asking the user to confirm the action.

## Develop

Get the code and set your own `wedge` command to resolve to that codebase.
